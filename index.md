### Deep Learning

[Attention-based Convolutional Architectures Improve Transfer Learning for
Distracted Driving Classification](/pdf/CS_7643_DDClassification.pdf)

Transfer learning is much faster than end-to-end weight training, but it is historically bad at classifying classes with minor differences. Here, I explored the impact on overall and class-by-class accuracy of using a modern, attention-based convolutional architecture for improving accuracy on a dataset with minor differences between classses.

### Other Experiments

FIRE Tool

The Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement relies on 4% safe withdrawl limit established in the 1998 Trinity Study. However, this study looks at a maximum of a 30 year withdrawl rate which is too short for most of those participating in FIRE. I created a tool to explore the probability of success for a user inputed investment, withdrawl, start date, and retirement date for every historical month of the S&P500.
