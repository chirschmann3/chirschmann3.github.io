### Deep Learning

[Attention-based Convolutional Architectures Improve Transfer Learning for
Distracted Driving Classification](/pdf/CS_7643_DDClassification.pdf)
Transfer learning is much faster than end-to-end weight training, but it is historically bad at classifying classes with minor differences. Here, I explored the impact on overall and class-by-class accuracy of using a modern, attention-based convolutional architecture for improving accuracy on a dataset with minor differences between classses.
